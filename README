This is terse but detailed list of steps to develop the model.  See ResearchPlanMSNsignalingPathway.txt for bigger picture, including
     What are the big research questions
     What are some little research questions
     Some experiments that can help test/develop the model
     See NeuroRD.bat for information on how to run models
This file is also used to keep track of which steps have been done, and what needs to be done next.
Details of what was done with a summary of results (with xml filenames) are reported in Notebook subdirectory:
Notebook files should have following name format: year_MM_DD_lastname
Information: goal/plan of the days work, e.g. data trying to simulation
	     names of xml files and directorys created (e.g. if subset of rxn file used, or different stim file)
	     table of results: parameters tried and summary of results
	     conclusion / next steps (e.g. parameters X matched, copied into main Rxn file; or try parameters Z next time)

Step 1. Merge reactions from modified version of Rodrigo's model and BoHung's model
Notes in the RXN file indicate whether the reaction came from the Gs model (Oliveira 2012) or Gq model (Kim 2013)
DONE.  1A. Merge reactions
DONE. 1B. Use the smaller, 1 spine morphology
IN PROGRESS. 1C. Create initial IC file - BALANCE ALL SPECIES, concentration and total PKA, etc in dend sm and spine head
DONE. 1D. Create a no stim file
DONE. 1E. Create an everything and a simpler/reduced IO file
Compare rate constants with xpp model and Oliveira model: which rates match references theirin, which ones do not match references, which rates don't have references.
DONE Search for updated references for rates with none or non-matching refs.  
DONE Check thermodynamic balance of some sets of reactions.

Step 2. Assays and adjustment to achieve correct basal cAMP and calcium
DONE. 2A. assays for PLC, Da binding to DR1 (very small subset of reactions) - PLCassay/, DRGassay/
DONE. 2B. IC and RXN for Gs production and binding (very small subset of reactions) - cAMPassay/
2C. IC and RXN for calmodulin, calbindin, pumps, affinity of Ca for Dagl and PLC - whole model but 3-5 comps (dend with sm)
2D. assays of DARPP32 phos in response to bath applied Da and Ca, as in Lindskog. -  whole model but 3-5 comps (dend with sm)
    May need to adjust PP2B vs PP2A activity (though both are from references)
2E. possibly include Gi reactions here to help decrease basal cAMP - simulate ss in whole, multi-comp model (witih spine)
    if Gi needed, first tune in 3-5 comp dend model and spine alone model

Step 3. Interaction between Gs and Gq/calcium pathways
3A. CaMKII inhibition of Dagl
3B. PKA enhances of Gq GAP activity?  Via RGS or D2 neuron only?
3C. Re-run Uchigashima bath application simulations - still valid?

Step 4.  Simulation experiments
4A. Stim files: Glu: how to account for release refractoriness and receptor desensitization (Ca and mGluR)?
    constrain by Lovinger imaging
4B. Stim files: Da and mACh: what pattern of release occurs (Da from Lovinger)
4C. Which temporal patterns select for LTP vs LTD? - repetition of BoHung sims
4D. Sensitivity to order of Ca and Da?  Do we need AC1 for this aspect?
