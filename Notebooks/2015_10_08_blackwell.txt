########## indicates the set of parameters used for the set of simulations

NEXT STEPS:
1. Merged Model:Finish updating MSPNmergedRateConst.xls
2. Research PIkinase from Falkenberg
3. repeat Da Bath to get more prolonged response (less ACh)

adjust PDEcAMP assay: rate of PKAc phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of PDE4 = Kf=0.125e-3, Kb=0.04, Kcat=0.01 in cAMPassay/Rxn_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PDE4.xml
Lower phos rate of DaD1R receptor: kf=0.0008e-3, kb=0.08e-3, kcat=0.02e-3
Keep PDE4 conc=100, possibly higher; cAMP basal = 73 
Depending on results, consider slowing GasGTP reaction, and keep higher ACh around to limit jpeak

(A) peak time of either PKAc or phospho targets (pPDE10, pDaD1RGs, pPDE4) around 30-40 sec. (B) Peak values of 1 s and 10 s are the same, peak value of 0.3 s is 80% of 1s, peak value of 0.1 s is 50% of 1s. (C) What is target cAMP value?

########## PDE4 phosphorylation rates: Kf=0.125e-3, Kb=0.12, Kcat=0.03 (~1/3 - 1/4 of previous), pPDE4 dephos = 0.005 (5x LOWER THAN PREVIOUS), pPDE10 dephos = 0.005 
changed ACh replacement to 0.01.  Because I forgot to increase duration of replacement, result was minimal replacement.
Result
1. cAMP still quite transient for all Da durations
-----> rate and quantity of ACh replacement is not important, it is not controling the cAMP decay
2. pPDE4: increases until 100 sec, and then very slowly decreases.
3.peak value of pPDE4 is now quite similar for all cases - not good.
4. peak of pDaD1RGs occurs ~30 sec after stimulation onset, slightly earlier for briefer Da stimuli.  THIS TIMING agrees with Castro AKAR3 response, but is probably controlled more by quantity of DaD1RGs than anything else, so not useful readout
5. cAMP peak is 5 uM (6000 nM) for 10s and 3 uM for 0.1 s.  This time course almost exactly matches the ACGasATP timecourse.
6. PKAc still does not discriminate Da duration
8. total pPDE4 is up to 7 nM

---------> Conclusion: To prolong peak cAMP, may need to slow down GasGTP hyrolysis to prolong ACGasATP (reaction: GasGTP -> GasGDP).  Or perhaps lower the quantity of PDE4 (e.g in IC file: IC_cAMPassay6.5uPKAcD1R_PDE4.xml, change the 100 nM to 50 nM)
