>>>>>>>>> indicates what we are trying to reproduce (goals)
---------> indicates conclusion from previous set of simulations of what needs to be done next
****** name of file that is either ready to go, or should have parameters changed according to --------->
########## indicates the set of parameters used for the set of simulations

NEXT STEPS:
1. Merged Model:Finish updating MSPNmergedRateConst.xls
2. Research PIkinase from Falkenberg
3. repeat Da Bath to get more prolonged response (less ACh)
   Do this after adding the optimal PDE paramters to the full model
4. Consider continuing to adjust cAMP assay
   in cAMPassay/Rxn_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PDE4.xml
   rate of PKAc phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of PDE4:
   	<!-- 09)  PKAc + PDE4 -> PKAcPDE4 -->, also rxn 10, 21, 22
	<!-- 11)  pPDE4 -> PDE4 -->
   rate of PKAc phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of PDE10:
   e.g. <!--1b. PKAc + PDE10cAMP -> PKAcPDE10cAMP --> and 4 others
   Change duration of ACh inhibition in Modelv3dt_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PDE4-Da*.xml
   inject ACh earlier at faster rate (more inhibition), or later at slower rate (less inhibition)
   if slower rate, make the rate (currently 0.03) lower, and the same value in all 4 Model files, i.e.g all 4 Da injections, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 10
   if later, change duration of ACh injection, but, make sure that the longer the Da pulse, the later the ACh injection and the larger the difference between buf onset and ACh onset

(A) peak time of either PKAc or phospho targets (pPDE10, pDaD1RGs, pPDE4) around 30-40 sec. (B) Peak values of 1 s and 10 s are the same, peak value of 0.3 s is 80% of 1s, peak value of 0.1 s is 50% of 1s. (C) What is target cAMP value?

########## PDE4 phosphorylation rates: Kf=0.125e-3, Kb=0.12, Kcat=0.03 (~1/3 - 1/4 of previous), pPDE4 dephos = 0.025, pPDE10 dephos = 0.005 
Result
1. basal cAMP ~66 nM, which is good
2. cAMP still quite transient for all Da durations, which may be is bad.
3. pPDE10 stops increasing  60 s after cAMP returns to basal.  This is better than prerviously.  So, these parameters will be kept.  Increase is slower than for PDE4, should phos and dephos rate be increased a bit?
4. pPDE4: increases until 60 sec, and then slowly decreases.
5. Peak of pPDE4 occurs ~40 s after stimulation onset, slightly later for 10s stimulation, peak of pDaD1RGs occurs ~30 sec after stimulation onset, slightly earlier for briefer Da stimuli.  THIS TIMING agrees with Castro AKAR3 response
6. peak value of pPDE4 for 0.1 s is ~50% of the 10s case, but the 1s case is similar to 0.3 s case.
7. cAMP peak is 6 uM (6000 nM) for 10s and 3 uM for 0.1 s
8. total pPDE4 remains below 4 nM, which might be too low

---------> Conclusion: To lower peak cAMP, could increse rate of phosphorylation of PDE4, but this would also speed to decay, and make it more transient.
Alternatively, change rate of ACh replacement?
