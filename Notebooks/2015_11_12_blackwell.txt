########## indicates the set of parameters used for the set of simulations

NEXT STEPS:
1. Merged Model:Finish updating MSPNmergedRateConst.xls
2. Research PIkinase from Falkenberg
3. repeat Da Bath to get more prolonged response (less ACh) using rates from cAMP assay
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running cAMP assay simulations with the following new rates:
PDEcAMP assay: rate of PKAc phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of PDE4 = 
	Kf=0.125e-3, Kb=0.04, Kcat=0.01 in 
Lower phos rate of DaD1R receptor: kf=0.0008e-3, kb=0.08e-3, kcat=0.02e-3
	both are in cAMPassay/Rxn_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PDE4.xml
Try two different PDE4 conc:
    PDE4=100 - Modelv3dt_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PD4E100-Da*.xml
    	     uses cAMPassay/IC_cAMPassay6.5uPKAcD1R_PD4E100.xml 
    PDE4=50, PDE10=110 (total 120, 20% higher) PDE2=60 (20%higher)
    	     Modelv3dt_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PD4E100-Da*.xml
	     uses IC_cAMPassay6.5uPKAcD1R_PD4E50.xml
Depending on results, consider slowing GasGTP hydrolysis to prolong ACGasATP, and keep higher ACh around to limit peak, coupled with no replacement since it doesn't seem to be controlling decay.  Or, possibly much later replacement for the 10s Da only.
--------->
1. Basal cAMP similar for PDE4=50 and PDE4=100
2. cAMP still quite transient; AChm4RGi is only minimally replaced, so this is not cause of transience.
3. Peak of cAMP is ~2x larger for PDE4=50 than PDE4=100.
3. ACGasATP is quite transient - this is cause of transience.  Need to slow GasGTP hydrolysis, but keep the PDE4=100, else the peak will be even larger OR less decrease in ACh.
########## GasGTP hydrolysis changed from 1.0 to 0.5 in 
	   cAMPassay/Rxn_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PDE4.xml
	   Abuf stim changed from 15 to 10 in
	   cAMPassay/Modelv3dt_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PD4E100-Da*.xml
	   Keep the ACh replacement the same, because currently the cAMP never returns to basal. But, consider increasing PDE10 by 10
	   if necessary to reduce Abuf still more, halve the duration
	   use same IC_cAMPassay6.5uPKAcD1R_PD4E100.xml as above sims
GOAL: Need to keep cAMP conc lower but durations different to see PKAc difference (hence increase PDE10 and lower Abuf still more)

(A) peak time of either PKAc or phospho targets (pPDE10, pDaD1RGs, pPDE4) around 30-40 sec. (B) Peak values of 1 s and 10 s are the same, peak value of 0.3 s is 80% of 1s, peak value of 0.1 s is 50% of 1s. (C) What is target cAMP value?
