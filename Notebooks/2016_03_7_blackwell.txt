#######Used new CamKII model in Uchi simulations.
<!--2a) 3 CKCamCa4 + 1 CKCamCa4 <-> 3  CKCamCa4 + 1 CKpCamCa4-->10.8e-18 
<!--2b)  2 CKCamCa4 + 1 CKCamCa4 <-> 2 CKCamCa4 + 1 CKpCamCa4-->1.68e-12 
<!--2c)  2 CKpCamCa4 + 2 CKCamCa4 <-> 3 CKpCamCa4 + 1 CKCamCa4-->18.8e-18 

Results: Slightly less pDgl than with old model.
Repeat Assay and Uchi with 20% higher values

#######2a: 13e-18, 2b: 2e-12, 2c: 27.1e-18
1hz: 729n (0.08), 2.5Hz:3.4uM (0.39), 4Hz: 5.7uM (0.65) 
CamKII is similar to old model, but no higher - same values as with 2c:22.6e-18

#######3x increase:
0.12e-6 for CKCam , 0.15e-6 for CKpCam for kf of Dgl phosphorylation
molecule    1s peak	  5s
CKpCamCa4   4.0n	  23 nm
pDgl	    14nm	  20nm
CapDgl	    6nm		  12nm
This is better than before, but still quite low.
---------> Should kf be even higher?  Or should there be no change?  The pDgl persists for duration of simulation.  Possibly the spacing of trains for LTP would yield a cumulative increase in pDgl that would have an effect.
---------> Try 10x kf, and also set up stimuli for LTP and LTD
	   i.e., Da, Ca, Glu, ACh.  Start with Da, and maybe get Ca and Glu from Asia's model.
	   
#######10x increase:
0.4e-6 for CKCam and CKp, 0.5e-6 for CKCam , 0.15e-6 for CKpCam for kf of Dgl phosphorylation
molecule    1s peak/ss	  5s
CKpCamCa4   2nM	  	  12 nM
pDgl	    35nM/31	  35nM/35
CapDgl	    12nM/6.5	  17nM/8
Much higher pDgl, either Ca bound or not.  Lower CKpCamCa4, likely due to binding to Dgl. Rate of increase: reaches peak within 10s-20s, possibly because CKpCam and CKcam go back down.
First try 3x value as default for LTP/LTD sims, then consider the 10x value if needed.

Ca stim: for Uchi 100 ms, needed to double the calcium.  Do this for initial theta and 20 Hz stim. For 20Hz: from 256 to 512 for spine, from 260 to 520 for dend.
Glu stim: for Uchi needed to double the Glu.  Do this for theta and 20 Hz.

>>>>>>>>>Da: Zhang and Sulzer, Nat Neuro
p2:p1=0.5, from 4p expers, it seems that p2:p4 together contribute less than p1, e.g. p3:p2=0.5, p4:p3=0.5
Threlfell &Cragg: subsequent Da pulses contribute very little: specify 1st pulse much higher for each train
peak=0.5 uM +/- 0.2 uM Salinas; Cragg: 0.4-1.0 uM peak Da; 20 pulses at 5 Hz has minimally higher peak, but decays to ~30% of peak for duration of train
decay: tau=0.376sec: salinas

>>>>>>>>>Summary:
20 Hz:
   adjust p1 to produce ~0.5 uM
   Adjust subsequent pulses to produce ~1.0 uM for 4 pulses, but first try p2,p3,p4 each half of previous, p5-x same as p4
theta:
   p1 must be same as for 20 Hz
   subsequent pulses should be larger than for 20 Hz (assuming that 100 Hz more similar to 50 Hz).
   Armando has data showing that theta yields less Da than 100 Hz, is it possible that the 35 ms pause (28 hz) reduces Da?
   Alternative: first burst produces Da of ~2x amplitude of 1st four pulses of 20 Hz, or 2x amplitude of single pulse
   	Subsequent bursts: lower - Zhang and Sulzer show that 10 pulses at 100 hz provides ~70% greater peak than 4 pulses.
	I.e. 6 additional pulses provide 70%,
	extrapolate to 8 additional pulses would double the 4 pulse peak, or provide an increment the same as 4 pulses -> half the amplitude.

#######Stim files (StimTheta10hz-10sITI.xml, Stim20hz-10sITI.xml):
   20 Hz: p1 =15ms*80 p2=15ms*40,p3=5ms*50, p4-100=5ms*30
     	Will re-adjust as needed in full model, which has Da decay
	may need to make subsequent pulses even smaller
   Theta:
	Each burst of 4p=single Da pulse.  burst 1 = 60ms*60. Bursts 2-10 produce half amplitude bursts. 60ms*30. Each train starts at full amplitude.
   Theta should produce Da a bit lower than 20 Hz, significantly lower than 100 Hz - adjust with Armando's data
-------->20Hz: 1st pulse: 0.4 uM, Da is double after 4p: 50% is too high
------>theta: 1st burst: 1.5 uM (too high)
#######A. for subsequent pulse use 40%, 15ms*80,15ms*32,15ms*12.8,5ms*15.4
B. b1=60ms*40, b2-10=60ms*20
-------->


ACh: What sort of burst/pause response should there be?
	 
&&&&&&& What mechanisms for Da decay (and glu decay)?
     a. inject Da buffer
     b. DaOut
     c. DaOut plus DaOut buffer (to prevent baseline shift)
     	Inject Dbuf after each 20Hz train or each theta train
Re-adjust inject

#######Change Dabuf to DaOut - add DaOut (and GluOut) to IC
--------> Simulations using kf=2.00e-3,kb=.02e-6 for Da, and
	  kf=0.5e-3, kb=0.02e-6 for Glu had no baseline buildup with Ext=0
	  Da decay ~1 sec - slightly larger than tau = 0.38 s. Make slower
	  Glu decay much slower, ~1 sec. Peak = 3.8uM Theta, 2uM 20Hz; Make faster?
	  20hz stim: Da is too low.  Go back to larger increments
#######	  kf=1.50e-3,kb=.02e-6 for Da
	  Stim: p1 =15ms*80 p2=15ms*40,p3=15ms*20, p4-100=5ms*30=150
------>  20Hz is better - 4 pulses is ~60% greater than 1, but 10 pulses is not100% greater than 1 p: increase the 4-10th pulse amplitude
	  Theta: Decay is better. 1burst produces 1 uM, which is more than 2s response to 1 pulse: increase 1p for 20Hz
	  PROBLEM: basal Da = 0.  Need to change basal to 10 nM, which might be difficult with DaOut=0.
######	 20Hz: p1:15ms*100, p2: 15ms*50, p3: 15ms*25, p4-100=15ms*15
	 Dabasal=10 (with DaOut=0), Glubasal=10 (with Gluout=0)
	  Theta: same params
------>subsequent pulses not  contributing enough for 20Hz - do not decrement by 50% the 3d and 4-100 pulses. 
------> basal is decreasing to 0, add DaOut
###### Try 60%: p3=30*15ms, p4-100=20*15ms20Hz, DaOut=200 uM
------>20Hz Da at 10p = 940, vs 1 p = 450.  Need slightly more, 10p > 2*1p
	    Basal Da is ~5, needs to be 10. Basal Glu = 0 (mistake in GluOut)
	    DaOut increases by ~20% during stim - need to elminate that excess Da. 
###### Try 70%:p3=35*15ms, p4-100=25*15ms for 20Hz
To limit buildup of DaOut and GluOut:
-------> Add in DaOut+Dbuf and GluOut+Gbuf to Rxn file
------->Stimulate with Dbuf and Gbuf after each train
######   Inject Dbuf: 2.0*2000, period=15s for theta, 1.25*2000, period=10s for 20Hz
       Inject Gbuf: same duration, rate, period, end, trains as Glu, but offset by 1 sec.
------->Da basal ~6, Glu basal ~7
	   GluOut - oscillates about 200 uM, but too rapidly: slow down binding or inject
	   DaOut - continues to increase - less than half is buffered
######  Gbuf: 20 ms * 15 (instead of 5 ms*60), 100 ms period for 20 Hz
	      2000 ms * 6, repeated 10x for Theta
	      Both injected during 2 sec after train ends
	Dbuf: double the rate of inject for both, to 2.5 (for 2000ms)
	kb for DaOut=0.06e-6, Kb for GluOut=0.024e-6 50% inc for both
--------> GluOut - ~1% shift at max, even less change in min after all the stimuli
	  DaOut - 5% increase during train, still need more Dbuf inject
	  Basal:  Glu 5-9 (sl. low) and Da 7-10 (good) no shift 
###### inc kb for GluOut = 0.03e-6
       Dbuf - calculate that 4.0 is required rate for 20 Hz (inc from 2.5)
       Da for theta: each burst > 2 uM, greater than 20 Hz, Armando says it is lower (certainly no higher).  Peak is 1.2 uM for 20 Hz.  Either raise 20 Hz or lower theta (or both).
       	  1. Raise 20 Hz Da (and Dbuf) 20% to 5.0 Dbuf and 120,60,42,30
	  2. Lower Da for subsequent trains for Theta, from 20 to 15, Dbuf=5.0
---------> Da Peak: 1.7 uM for 1st burst, 2.1 for last burst of Theta
	      1.6 uM for all 20 Hz trains, 
	   DaOut: <1% inc in basal for theta, <.1% dec in basal for 20Hz
----------> Reduce slightly the 20Hz Dbuf, since in full model some of Da will be bound, and simulate full model 	   

>>>>>>>>> Measured effect of CaMKII phos of Dg on 2ag production by setting to 0 kf for CamKII binding to Dgl:
-------->Result was 1. greater CkpCamCa4 (free - not bound to Dgl, peak of 20-25 vs 10-12, and no decrement) and
		2. peak 2ag of 320 vs 230.
	This suggests that should not use the highest CKpCam affinity for Dgl, else CKpCam will not be available for other targets, e.g. autophos

&&&&&&& Still need to add reactions: PKA phos RGS4, RGS4 degrade Gi
	      	   Stim: ACh (basal with pauses (AChbuf, then ACh) after Da?)
	May need to re-adjust stim with receptors present
&&&&&&& May need to repeat the DaBath, CaBath, DaCaBath, CyA and OA sims in full model to ensure those responses have not changed to much
