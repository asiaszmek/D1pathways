#######Used new CamKII model in Uchi simulations.
<!--2a) 3 CKCamCa4 + 1 CKCamCa4 <-> 3  CKCamCa4 + 1 CKpCamCa4-->10.8e-18 
<!--2b)  2 CKCamCa4 + 1 CKCamCa4 <-> 2 CKCamCa4 + 1 CKpCamCa4-->1.68e-12 
<!--2c)  2 CKpCamCa4 + 2 CKCamCa4 <-> 3 CKpCamCa4 + 1 CKCamCa4-->18.8e-18 

Results: Slightly less pDgl than with old model.
Repeat Assay and Uchi with 20% higher values

#######2a: 13e-18, 2b: 2e-12, 2c: 27.1e-18
1hz: 729n (0.08), 2.5Hz:3.4uM (0.39), 4Hz: 5.7uM (0.65) 
CamKII is similar to old model, but no higher - same values as with 2c:22.6e-18

#######3x increase:
0.12e-6 for CKCam , 0.15e-6 for CKpCam for kf of Dgl phosphorylation
molecule    1s peak	  5s
CKpCamCa4   4.0n	  23 nm
pDgl	    14nm	  20nm
CapDgl	    6nm		  12nm
This is better than before, but still quite low.
---------> Should kf be even higher?  Or should there be no change?  The pDgl persists for duration of simulation.  Possibly the spacing of trains for LTP would yield a cumulative increase in pDgl that would have an effect.
---------> Try 10x kf, and also set up stimuli for LTP and LTD
	   i.e., Da, Ca, Glu, ACh.  Start with Da, and maybe get Ca and Glu from Asia's model.
	   
#######10x increase:
0.4e-6 for CKCam and CKp, 0.5e-6 for CKCam , 0.15e-6 for CKpCam for kf of Dgl phosphorylation
molecule    1s peak/ss	  5s
CKpCamCa4   2nM	  	  12 nM
pDgl	    35nM/31	  35nM/35
CapDgl	    12nM/6.5	  17nM/8
Much higher pDgl, either Ca bound or not.  Lower CKpCamCa4, likely due to binding to Dgl. Rate of increase: reaches peak within 10s-20s, possibly because CKpCam and CKcam go back down.
First try 3x value as default for LTP/LTD sims, then consider the 10x value if needed.

Ca stim: for Uchi 100 ms, needed to double the calcium.  Do this for initial theta and 20 Hz stim. For 20Hz: from 256 to 512 for spine, from 260 to 520 for dend.
Glu stim: for Uchi needed to double the Glu.  Do this for theta and 20 Hz.

>>>>>>>>>Da: Zhang and Sulzer, Nat Neuro
p2:p1=0.5, from 4p expers, it seems that p2:p4 together contribute less than p1, e.g. p3:p2=0.5, p4:p3=0.5
Threlfell &Cragg: subsequent Da pulses contribute very little: specify 1st pulse much higher for each train
peak=0.5 uM +/- 0.2 uM Salinas; Cragg: 0.4-1.0 uM peak Da; 20 pulses at 5 Hz has minimally higher peak, but decays to ~30% of peak for duration of train
decay: tau=0.376sec: salinas

>>>>>>>>>Summary:
20 Hz:
   adjust p1 to produce ~0.5 uM
   Adjust subsequent pulses to produce ~1.0 uM for 4 pulses, but first try p2,p3,p4 each half of previous, p5-x same as p4
theta:
   p1 must be same as for 20 Hz
   subsequent pulses should be larger than for 20 Hz (assuming that 100 Hz more similar to 50 Hz).
   Armando has data showing that theta yields less Da than 100 Hz, is it possible that the 35 ms pause (28 hz) reduces Da?
   Alternative: first burst produces Da of ~2x amplitude of 1st four pulses of 20 Hz, or 2x amplitude of single pulse
   	Subsequent bursts: lower - Zhang and Sulzer show that 10 pulses at 100 hz provides ~70% greater peak than 4 pulses.
	I.e. 6 additional pulses provide 70%,
	extrapolate to 8 additional pulses would double the 4 pulse peak, or provide an increment the same as 4 pulses -> half the amplitude.

#######Stim files (StimTheta10hz-10sITI.xml, Stim20hz-10sITI.xml):
   20 Hz: p1 =15ms*80 p2=15ms*40,p3=5ms*50, p4-100=5ms*30
     	Will re-adjust as needed in full model, which has Da decay
	may need to make subsequent pulses even smaller
   Theta:
	Each burst of 4p=single Da pulse.  burst 1 = 60ms*60. Bursts 2-10 produce half amplitude bursts. 60ms*30. Each train starts at full amplitude.
   Theta should produce Da a bit lower than 20 Hz, significantly lower than 100 Hz - adjust with Armando's data
-------->20Hz: 1st pulse: 0.4 uM, Da is double after 4p: 50% is too high
------>theta: 1st burst: 1.5 uM (too high)
#######A. for subsequent pulse use 40%, 15ms*80,15ms*32,15ms*12.8,5ms*15.4
B. b1=60ms*40, b2-10=60ms*20

ACh: What sort of burst/pause response should there be?
	 
&&&&&&& What mechanisms for Da decay (and glu decay)?
     a. inject Da buffer
     b. DaOut
     c. DaOut plus DaOut buffer (to prevent baseline shift)
     	Inject Dbuf after each 20Hz train or each theta train
Re-adjust inject

-------> Change Dabuf to DaOut - add DaOut (and GluOut) to IC
-------> Add in DaOut+Dbuf and GluOut+Gbuf to Rxn file
------->Stimulate with Dbuf and Gbuf after each train
Test stim files, and then do full sims
