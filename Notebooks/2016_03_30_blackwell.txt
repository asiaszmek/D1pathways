&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		 3. Can extra high calcium substitute for dopamine in LTP?  If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq?
		    Simulate with decrease Da and increase Ca
		 4. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 5. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    Create signature
		    Can some molecules substitute for others (increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block)

&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2 model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 wit Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim
   
3. Repeat all stim patterns used to constrain params in full model
	e.g. Castro sims - quant and time course of PKA activity, cAMP
             Add AKAR from Nair - PKA phos and PP1 dephos - to compare PKA activity
        Assays on Da binding to Receptor?
        Control of Dp34 (basal=400 nM, 11x with Da) and Dp75 (basal 11-12 uM, dec with Da)
	Assays of Da stim  may require concommitant reduction in ACh
	Effect of calcium on Dp34 and Dp75, etc (not done by nair).
	Effect of PP inhibitors (not done by nair)
	Also: 	
	Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation)

########## Kd=1000 for ACh binding to m4 (low affin), kf=0.0025, kb=2.5
	   Kd = 100 nM high affin, kf=0.05, kb=2.5
--------->basal cAMP = 34 - not bad, Ca=85 (still a bit high)
		cAMP increases to ~130 during stim, then increases to >6 uM when stim is done
	basal Ip3 is 2x too high - need lower binding rate
	Found alternative estimates for ACh binding to m1 and m4:
	A. high affin=1096nM, low affin=14.8 uM Leach et al.
	B. Kellar says high affin=37, doesn't give low affin; also m1 has lower fraction of receptors in high affinity state
	
#########Try Leach et al. values for m4R, with 100 nM (higher) basal ACh.
	     Try Waelbroec Molec Pharm vol59 for m1R binding
	    Add in AKAR phos and dephos from Nair et al. 2015
	    Run Da, Ca, DaCa bath (with Abuf, no AKAR); Da for 0.1-100 sec (AKAR, no Abuf)
	    	assess Darpp forms, PKA (AKAR), cAMP
Leach may be too low an affinity for m4R, and too low for the low affin receptor, but definitely allows modulation by burst.
If too low affinity, try 10x affinity (e.g. 109.6 nM for high - closer to Kellar), and use 14x difference for the low affin m1, and also add in AC1 - to improve basal cAMP/PKA/Dp34PP1.
