Lab Notebook for Blackwell Nov 20, 2015 - Dec 2, 2015
>>>>>>>>> indicates what we are trying to reproduce (goals)
---------> indicates conclusion from previous set of simulations of what needs to be done next
****** name of file that is either ready to go, or should have parameters changed according to --------->
########## indicates the set of parameters used for the set of simulations

NEXT STEPS:
1. Repeat Uchigashima and Bohung sims while adjusting Gq pathways and spine densities
2. Research PIkinase from Falkenberg
3. Add in CamKII inhib of DagL
4. Repeat theta and 20Hz simulations

Updated MSPNmergedRateConst.xls and Rxn*.xml file for whole model simulation
Repeated the Da bath, Ca bath, CyA and OA block cases
######### Results
1. Da now produces increase in Dp34PP1: from 867 nM to 3.4 uM, in 1 min
      	  	   decrease in Dp75: from 9.8 uM to 6.6 uM in 2 min
		   cAMP has more prolonged increase, decrease is similar to time course of PDE10 phosphorylation 
	-------> Good, but basal cAMP is a bit high, and phos of DaD1RGs is too low
	reduce DaD1RGs dephos, from 5 to 2
	increase PDE10total from 100 to 120
2. Block:
   block1=OA (PP1/PP2A) - PP1 was not being reduced!!!
   No increase in Dp34PP1, large increase in Dp75 - saturates at 45 uM
   block2=CyA (PP2B) - no effect on Dp75, slight increase in Dp34PP1, but simulation didn't run past 100s 
   re-run block1 with 10% of free PP1
   re-run both blocks with the increased PDE10

######### Results
1. Da: cAMP basal: 133.6, peak: 6 uM - follows ACGasATP time course
       PKAc basal: 12, peak 45 nM - delayed increase and more prolonged than cAMP
       Dp34PP1 basal: 804, peak 3.8 uM, minimal decay by 240 sec
       Dp75 basal: 9.8 uM but not really steady; decreasing to 6 uM
       phospho PDE: pde10 begins to increase at 110 sec, PDE4 increases a bit later
       pDaD1RGS increases around 130sec.  These may be causing the cAMP decay.
--------> STILL NEED LOWER BASAL cAMP.  Another increase in PDE4/10
	  PDE4 inc from 100 to 120, PDE10 inc from 120 to 150
2. Ca: cAMP, AC, PKAc exhibit trivial decrease.
   Dp34PP1 - decrease from 800 to 300 - EXCELLENT
   Dp75: decrease from 9.8 uM to 5 uM - very good.  Only problem is that basal is too low.  
----> Increase CDK5 by 20%, from 420 to 520 in IC file
3. Block
   block1=OA (PP1/PP2A) - Large increase in Dp75 - saturates at 45 uM (4x increase)
   block2=CyA (PP2B) - no effect on Dp75 (Good). No increase in Dp34PP1
   -------> Effect on Dp75 is consistent with experiments
   	    Effect on Dp34 is not sufficient.  No increase seen with either block!
	    Definitely need to see increase with CyA - block more PP2B (down to 50 from 500)
######### Results of stronger PDEs and less PP2B during block:
1. Da: basal cAMP=79 - GREAT
       basal Dp34PP1 is now 462 - fine
       basal Dp75 is now  13 uM - too large, reduce CDk5 a bit.
3. Block
   block1=OA (PP1/PP2A) - Large increase in Dp75 - saturates at 45 uM (4x increase)
   	     		no effect on Dp34
   block2=CyA (PP2B) - no effect on Dp75 (Good).
   	      	     Small increase in Dp34PP1 to 600?  Vs 400 with OA. 
   -------> Effect on Dp75 is consistent with experiments
   	    Effect on Dp34 is small, needs to be larger.
NEW SIMS with reduced CDK5, only 10 PP2B for CyA
1. Da basal cAMP = 76 (stoch var)
   basal Dp34PP1 = 542 (stoch var?), peak=1358.91 - 3X INCREASE
   Dp75 basal is now 12420, dec to 9146.04 during PKA - reasonable (or stochastic? reduction)
2. Ca: Dp34 decreases to 230 - 50% - consistent with expers
       Dp75 decreases to 6 uM - 50% - slightly less than expers, but still pretty good.  Might get larger reduction with PP2B interaction with CDK5?
3. Block
   block1=OA (PP1/PP2A) - Large increase in Dp75 - saturates at 45 uM (4x increase)
   	     		Dp34 peak = 535 (same as basal)
   block2=CyA (PP2B) - no effect on Dp75 (Good)
   	      	     Dp34 peak = 655 - and increase, but not enough

Begin to Repeat BoHung stim sims using new PLC rates
   1st, run simulation with no stim and with spine
****** Model_MSPNmergeSpine.xml uses:
       IC_MSPNmergePKAcD1R.xml (IC_MSPNmergeDendPKAcD1R.xml with Spine values)
       Rxn_MSPNmergePKAcD1R.xml (same as used for bath sims)
       Morph_1spine2umDend.xml
    These sims will be used to adjust IC for ss and total quantities
   2nd, try the Uchigashima, theta and 20 Hz
      May need to increase catalytic rate of PLC or reduce GAP activity to achieve sufficientDAG and 2AG 

>>>>>>>>> Goal Measurements of Dp34 and Dp75:
Okadaic Acid (OA) increases Dp34 by 5x: Nishi J Neurchem 1999, 5x:Nishi J Neurchem 2002
Cyclosporin A increases Dp34 by 17x: Nishi J Neurochem 1999, 3x:Nishi J Neurchem 2002
Both occur VERY slowly, more than 30 minutes.  Also Dp34 increases in 0 calcium
Dp75: 3x inc with OA, not CyA (60 min)
Blocking PP2A (OA) increases Dp75 by 3x (60 min expers)
Blocking PP2B (CyA) has no effect on Dp75 (60 min exprs)
Ca Bath : 50% reduction in Dp34, 75% reduction in Dp75 (Nishi JNeurochem 2002)
Da Bath: increase in Dp34 inc 5x (5 min), Dp75 dec 50% (1 min)
