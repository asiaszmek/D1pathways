Next steps:
How to better distinguish the shorter durations? 
1. Using the GapGs model, try Da decay slower for 1s faster for 0.1s?  ACh returns faster for 0.1s?  Perhaps ACh returns sooner with long Da stim to limit cAMP?
Compare 10s cAMP with Castro Fig 2,6
2.  repeat (original and altered Da/ACh kinetics) with the GapGi model
3. Continue preparing Calcium ss full model

Goals for today :
A. cAMP in Merged model
FIX: 3x reaction rate for ACh + Abuf to drop ACh faster.
If faster reaction, might not need the excess (at end of Abuf injection, Abuf is in excess), so try some lower values:
-->Abuf=180, 240, 300, maybe even 120
>>>>>>>>>RESULTS (0.003e-3 Abuf rxn, GapGs)
Abuf	ACh	       GaiGTP	 cAMP	PKAr
180	0, 53p, 38     6	 2131	28, 18s
240	0, 53p, 42     4	 2270	28, 18s  
300	0, 65p, 48     4	 2601	27, 182
Problem with all is that cAMP inc is slower than cAMP dec - the double peak is not apparent, but cAMP production stil spread out.
Try 3x faster still, only use the two lower values, do Gi also.
>>>>>>>>>RESULTS (0.01e-3 Abuf rxn, GapGs)
Abuf/Gap  cAMP	   PKAr
180/Gs	  3.3uM	   30 
180/Gi	  15.8uM   36
240/Gs	  6uM	   32
240/Gi	  18uM	   37
Shape of cAMP is better for GapGs than for GapGi
      inc and dec similar speed for GapGs
      inc very slow, and dec barely started for GapGi
Note that Da and DaD1RGs not quite returning to basal.  Tweak buf injection a tiny bit.
ACh dropping to zero within 5 sec for both, returning to basal within 10 sec with minimal overshoot for both Abuf and both Gaps
-->Select best values for simulating different Da durations (scale the value for briefer Da). USE GapGs for different Da durations, use the higher (240) Abuf. Speed up ACh - Abuf binding even more (0.05e-3), because peak cAMP needs to come within 15 sec of Da onset. Restore ACh slower for brief Da pulses.
Da dur	  cAMP 	      PKAc
0.1	1.0  	      34  all except 10s decays within 60s
0.3	1.3	      40
1	1.5	      43 decay slightly longer
10	20 uM	      65 nM, prolonged
Note that Da and DaD1RGs remains elevated for all but briefest Da pulse - increase the other 3 next time
ACh returns to slightly higher than basal for one duration, though GaiGTP returns to basal.
GasGTP can distinguish 10s from 1s from (0.1/0.3s) of Da
How to better distinguish the shorter durations?
1. Da decay slower for 1s?  ACh returns faster for 0.1s?

B. Calcium - incorporate cAMP reactions and rates into full model, and run new calcium steady state (with higher Leak)
1. make sure Rxn and IC same is for calcium ss subset DONE
2. make sure cAMP rxn and IC same as for best cAMP assay
3. Assess DARPP32 ss; update rates, PP2A quant and rate constant source notes

C. Once cAMP/PKA working:
Re-do Neves?  Was there mistake in basal Da requiring lower PDE10 for that model also?
Can Neves model work with ACGs or ACGsGi Gap activity?  Can Neves model work with only increase PDE2 to account for cGMP?
