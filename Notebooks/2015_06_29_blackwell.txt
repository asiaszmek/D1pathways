NEXT STEPS:
A. Steady State
1. Check the PP2B-Cam binding
2. re-run the ss sim for 100s - adjust  calcium (get the avg.txt file)
   From previous tries, I had 1.2 PKAc, 3uM CDK5 - so can inc PKA if now too low, and further inc CDK5
3. run the ss sim using a smaller dendrite - compare
4. run the ss sim using the PDE2 needed from the cAMP assay - both dend diam - compare

B. Better PKA activity decay:
Increase PDE2 to 100 nM? add an AKAR sensor, with good PKAc affinity/speed and some rate of PP1 dephos, then measure the duration of that signal
While running the calcium steady states, find some AKAR references

C. Re-do Neves to re-assess PDE2 needed for dend and soma

D. Bath application:
Select from (A) and bath apply NMDA (Ca) and Da (reduce ACh), effect of PP2A or PP2B blocked? Find data traces to compare to
Ca bath (ctrl, PP2B inact or PP2A inact); 500 sec
Da bath
CaDa bath

A. Try to improve Castro just a bit more using (a) slighlty slower ACh and Dabuf injection or
(b) slower GapGi activity?  Would either prolong cAMP and PKA decay, or just increase peak?
Make ACh and Dabuf inject slower:
				DaD1RGs		cAMP		PKAc
10s: 7.83*20s, Abuf=0.24*10s 	0     		33uM		67, no decay
1s: 7.83*20s, Abuf=0.24*10s	1.0     	12.4uM		66, >2 min decay
0.3s: 15.66*10s, Abuf=0.24*10s	0.7     	10uM too high	66, 2 min decay
0.1s				0		0.7uM good	1 min decay
Conclusion: decay occurs when cAMP drops below threshold, so this is not a good way to control PKAc. Prefer to have lower cAMP with slower decay

Slow down GapGi activity (using which injection speeds?)
ACGasGaiATP--ACGai+Gs+cAMP forward rate = 0.005e-3 (from 0.01e-3)
Use the following injections:
				DaD1RGs	cAMP	PKAc
10s: 15.66*10s, Abuf=0.48*5s 	0.0   	25 uM	 70nM, no Decay
1s: 15.66*10s, Abuf=0.48*5s  	0.0   	5.0 uM	 58nM, decay to 20% in 1 min (too fast)
0.3s: 31.32*5s, Abuf=0.48*5s 	1.3   	2.6 uM	 50 nM, decay within 40s
0.1:  78.3*2s, Abuf:1.2*2s   	0.0   	0.7 uM	 26 nM, decay similar to 0.3s
cAMP quite similar to previous - Gap activity had very little effect

Second alternative -> Add in small amount of PDE2 to remove the extremely high peaks
Try 20 to 100 nM cytosol.  This will blunt the very high peak, but will not necessarily decay the PKAc drop.  In fact it will probably accelerate it.
ACGasATP exhibits very sharp peak, ACGasGaiATP has broad peak.  ACGasATP is dropping faster than DaD1RGs; correlates with the return of AC -> delay the ACh recovery.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>RESULTS
ACGasGaiATP--ACGai+Gs+cAMP forward rate = 0.01e-3 (original); PDE2=50nM cyt
Use the following injections:
					DaD1RGs	cAMP	PKAc
10s: 15.66*10s, Abuf=0.48*5s,12s 	0.0   	22.8 uM	 70nM, begins steep decay after 60s
1s: 15.66*10s, Abuf=0.48*5s,2s  	1.2   	5.5 uM	 58nM, decay to 20% in 1 min (too fast)
0.3s: 31.32*5s, Abuf=0.48*5s,0.6ms 	0.0   	2.8 uM	 51 nM, decay within 40s
0.1:  78.3*2s, Abuf:1.2*2s,0.2ms   	2.1   	0.7 uM	 26 nM, decay similar to 0.3s
cAMP quite similar to previous except for the 10s stimuli, which indeed is better.  Could probably raise PDE2 even more to reduce the peak cAMP
GOOD NEWS: results are robust to PDE2 quantity, timing of ACh injection

HOW TO PROLONG PKA?  One possibility is that the duration is fine, and that AKAR measures PKAc vs PP1.  Could add an AKAR sensor, with good PKAc affinity/speed and some rate of PP1 dephos, then measure the duration of that signal

B. Continue with calcium ss in full model (what size dendrite?  Does it matter?), Tune quantities to obtain good basal DARPP.  First, double check rate constants from xl spreadsheet
Ca=37 (a bit low) - >>>increase leak rate a bit
CalbinC=8000, pmcaCa=20, ncxCa=151
PlcCa=5, ACCa=4, CaDgl=95, CamCa2C=160, CamCa2N=24, Cam=6580, PP2BCam
cAMP=28 (maybe slighty higher) PKAc=6, Dp34PP1=3500 (way too high), Dp75 dec to 4000 (way too low)
PP2BCamCa4 =2, binding to Dp34PP1 ~3, unable to see PP2A activity due to variable names
Dp75pPP2A > 100, Dp75PP2AC=4.  Why is pPP2A activity so high?
D32PKA=61 (good), PKAcPDE10=6 (fine) PkcCa=0 (not good) CKCamCa4=25 (fine)
Overall:
CDK5 needs to be higher, or pPP2A needs to be lower (faster dephos rate, lower quantity)
PP2B needs to dephos more of Dp34PP1 - increase quantity (increase PP2A rate)
1. increaes PP2B from 3uM to 4 uM (decrease Dp34PP1)
2. Increase Ca leak rate from 1.5e-6 to 2e-6 (increase Ca and Pp2B activity)
3. lowered PKAc phos of PP2A kcat from 0.1 to 0.06, raised kb from 0.3 to 0.37 (inc Dp75)
4. increase dephos rate of Pp2A to 0.008 from 0.004 (inc Dp75)

Continue checking rate constants against xl spreadsheet

>>>>>>>> RESULTS (Once Ca is well tuned, can further tweak phosphatases for DARPP)
Ca=55 nM (great) pmca~110, pmca~23, ncx~3.8u, ncxCa~127  NEED to check avg.txt file for sm conc; CalbinC=13 (quite low!), Calbin>160000!  How can that be?
Cam=4.4uM, CamCa2C~160,CamCa2N~30, CamCa4~1, Pp2BCam=2800, pp2bcamca2N=158,p2bcamca2C=1050
Pp2bcamca4=6,PDE1camca4=361 (how can that be?  affinity is lower than Pp2B)
CaDgl~140, PkcCa=40, low Ip3, pPP2A is increasing to 100, CDK5D32=800, very low PKAcPDE10
>>>Check PDE1camca4 and Pp2bCamca4 binding reactions
These look fine, but may need to write out to double check
CkCamCa4~40, no CKpCam (probably wrong - should be higher, is PDE1CamCa4 stealing all the active Cam?)
cAMP fluctuates about 30-50, PKAr=60, PKAc=7 free, 67 bound to D32, Dp34PP1 inc to 3.5 uM still
PP2AB56d is bound to 50 nM Dp34PP1, but PP2ABpr72 is not bound at all!  Strange.  Very little Pp2B (10) bound to Dp34PP1.
Dp75 dec to 75uM, Dp75PKA=20, BPR72 and B56d each bound to 150 nM Dp75, Dp75-Pp2AC=10, Dp75pPP2A=60.  PKAcPP2AB56d is 30 - half of Darpp bound (which has 30x quantity)

DONE >>>>To lower PKAc activity - lower the affinity back to 9.4 nM - much less PKAc, and thus less PKA phos of D32 and pp2A, this will lower Dp75pP2A also.
DONE >>>>Raise CDk5 anyway, because lowering PP2A might not be enough. (from 1000 to 1500)

Ca ss only requires 50 sec!!  Darpp32 ss requires closer to 100 s.  Only do 100s while adjusting rates initially.

C. Bath apply calcium/Da/reduce ACh, with and without PP2B blocked (see nebish sims or stim files for exact set of sims to constrain phosphatases)

D. Redo Neves to verify PDE quantities
