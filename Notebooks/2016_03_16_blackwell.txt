&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    Do sims with and without ACh modulation
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		 3. Can extra high calcium substitute for dopamine in LTP?  If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq?
		    Simulate with decrease Da and increase Ca
		 4. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims

To finish model:
A. Look for biochemical rates  (see Hellgren Publication) for
1. PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay)
2. ACh + m4R   (affinity measures) -> replace current values which are for D2R
3. Aden + A2A4  (affinity measures)
B. Create Stim files for ACh and Aden
C. Create reactions:
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
D. To create D2 model
   a. Replace D1 wit Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim

&&&&&&& Still need to add reactions: PKA phos RGS4, RGS4 degrade Gi
	      	   Stim: ACh (basal with pauses (AChbuf, then ACh) after Da?)
		   ACh: What sort of burst/pause response should there be?
	May need to re-adjust stim with receptors present
&&&&&&& May need to repeat the DaBath, CaBath, DaCaBath, CyA and OA sims in full model to ensure those responses have not changed to much

kf of CaOut+Leak dec from 2e-6 to 1.5e-6  Rationale: Lower basal calcium to lower basal PP2BCamCa4 to increase Dp34PP1
Da -> DaOut rate decreased from 1.5e-3 to 1.2e-3 Rationale: higher basal Da to increase basal cAMP to increase Dp34PP1
Rates of CaMKII phos of Dgl increased 3x Rationale: more CamKII inhib of Dgl with Theta

---------> Better, but still higher Da and lower Ca needed
Why is greater CKpCam not producing greater pDgl for theta?  Does greater Dag and Ca prevent CKpCam from acting on Dgl?

kf of CaOut+Leak dec from 1.5e-6 to 1.0e-6  Rationale: Lower basal calcium to lower basal PP2BCamCa4 to increase Dp34PP1
Da -> DaOut rate decreased from 1.2e-3 to 1.0e-3 Rationale: higher basal Da to increase basal cAMP to increase Dp34PP1

	    basal    20Hz   theta
cAMP	    41-49   1002    721		slightly higher basal and stimulated
PKAc	    1-2      29	    23
D32PKA	    11-14    278    244	      
Dp34PP1	    141-211  3727   3704      Same
Ca	    86-87    361    1320	SAME!
PP2BCamCa4  14	     109    415		SAME

Conclusion: cAMP, PKAc and Dp34PP1 slightly better.  Ca is still the same, and needs to be reduced further. 

Also, may need to decrease basal ACh and Gi to produce greater cAMP response.
Will ACh pause be greater for theta?  If so, that would enhance cAMP (and PKA) more for theta.  Otherwise, adding in RGS would not help, as it would be more active with 20 Hz.
