>>>>>>>>> indicates what we are trying to reproduce (goals)
---------> indicates conclusion from previous set of simulations of what needs to be done next
****** name of file that is either ready to go, or should have parameters changed according to --------->
########## indicates the set of parameters used for the set of simulations

NEXT STEPS:
1. Merged Model:Finish updating MSPNmergedRateConst.xls
2. Research PIkinase from Falkenberg
3. repeat Da Bath to get more prolonged response (less ACh) using rates from cAMP assay
########## GasGTP hydrolysis changed back to 1.0 in 
	   cAMPassay/Rxn_cAMPassayGapGiPKAphosD1R_PDE4.xml
	   Increase PDE10 10%, from 100 to 110 in
	   cAMPassay/IC_cAMPassay6.5uPKAcD1R_PD4E100.xml
---------> peak cAMP=3.5uM for Da=10s, 1.5 uM for Da=0.1 sec
	   PKAc looks slightly higher for longer stimuli
	   PDE phos doesn't match castro, BUT, pDaD1RGs looks similar: larger phos for longer Da.
Evaluate PKAc bound to its targets: very little variation with Da, except for DaD1RGs, and this is probably due to the time course of the DaD1RGs form
	 
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOWER cAMP PEAK, WHILE PROLONGING cAMP DURATION!!! because PKAc is more sensitive to cAMP duration if cAMP peak is so high
Tried slower GasGTP hydrolysis, but this only made cAMP higher.  WOuld need to couple  slower GasGTP hydrolysis with slower production
######### kcat of DaD1RGs could be slowed from 2.0 to 0.5 (4x slower) and then hydrolysis also slowed 4x from 1.0 to 0.25.
---------_> peak cAMP=3.5 uM (as before)
	    lowest value of cAMP = ~1000
	    PKA ranges from 32.55 (0.1s Da) to 42.56 (10s Da)
	    Still not prolonged enough, PKA still increases quite quickly
	    pPDE4 now shows a difference

######### Try additional slowdown? Gap = 0.125/sec, Kcat = 0.25
    Also, simulate for 300 sec (beginning at 30 sec) for better pre stim baseline, and to see of pPDE4 begins to decay
    If good, then copy new rates into whole model, update .xls, and continue adjusting merged model
    These slower rates may help with more prolonged response to Da Bath

(A) peak time of either PKAc or phospho targets (pPDE10, pDaD1RGs, pPDE4) around 30-40 sec. (B) Peak values of 1 s and 10 s are the same, peak value of 0.3 s is 80% of 1s, peak value of 0.1 s is 50% of 1s. (C) What is target cAMP value?
