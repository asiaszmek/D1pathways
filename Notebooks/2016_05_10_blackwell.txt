&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    >>Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    >>What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    >>Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		    	  replace m4R with D2R (and affinities), D1R with A2AR
			  need adenosine stim patterns
		 3. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    >>Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 4. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    >>Create signature
		    >>Can some molecules substitute for others? If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq? 
		    	increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block
		  	increase Ca and decrease dopamine.
		 5. Spatial specificity.  Compare 1 sp with 2 sp adjacent with 2 sp apart

&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
   small amount of AC1 to allow Theta to have higher cAMP and PKA??
2. To create D2R model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 with Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim
   
########## Simulations with NeuroRD-3.1.0.5, using 20 um long dendrite with multiple spines
Model_SPNspineCaMKII_DagL_AChm4R_20um-sp1-stim20hz.xml
Stim20hzACh-sp1.xml
Morph20um.xml
>>>>>>>>> 1. Output files are huge - 180 Mb (10x larger).  Edit output file to eliminate molecules I never evaluate.
	  2. Da is ~10x lower, both overall and spine. NOT REALLY: averaging over all spine heads - both stim and not.
--------->  Fixed neurordh5_analysis to analyze multiple spines.  Now, stim is quite similar in spines between 20um and 2 um dendrite.  However, ACh is extremely high in spine - ~700 nM.  May need to fix this.
	    Noticed that ACh is 700 in spine of both 20um and 2 um morphology, however ACh overall is too low in 20 um morphology.  Basal injection is into spine.  So, diffusion is limiting the overall concentration.  change basal injection to injection spines so it is better distributed.
	    
########## Simulate both 20 Hz and theta - 2um and 20 um morphology.  Repeat bath sims also.
	   Also, consider removing burst ACh stimulation frome dendrite (injection spines)
>>>>>ACh: basal is < 100 in spine and dendrite - this is fine now.	   
>>>>>>>Da Stim results: cAMP is very transient (except for the 10s stim).  This is likely due to the high ACGi.  Nonetheless, pAKAR3 can distinguish the different durations.  However, the 1s stim still produces much less pAKAR than does the 10s stim - not consistent with results.
>>>>>>>Bath stim results: Very similar to previous results (and to experiments):
	     	 basal/stim Dp34  goal     basal/stim Dp75 goal		assessment
	Da   	 378/4.9u   	   5x      10.8u/6.3u	50%	  	BOTH goals met
     	Ca   	 393n/152n	   50%     11.0u/7.4u	75%		BOTH goals met
      	DaCa	 327n/3.7u   	50% of Da  11.1u/5.3u			Close to goal met
	CyA:  	 285n/1185n	 3-17x 	   11.1u/10.3u	100%		3x over "max basal" of 400	
	OA:      565n/>890n	  5x	   45.5u	3x		2x over "max basal" of 400
	CyA+Ca	 312n/446n	  	   11.0u/7.6u	  	
	CyA+Da	 405n/4.9u		   11.0u/6.3u
--------->Overall assessment: Bath application is quite good.  Blockers only OK.
	Inc in Dp34 with CyA and OA alone are at low end of reported
	Da with CyA does not caused even bigger increase in Dp34 than Da alone, which is expected.
	Why does CyA alone causes initial drop in Dp34?
>>>>>> Stim cases:    basal   20hz	theta	AUC assessment
       Dp34PP1	     389-489  4.3u	4.3u	20hz slightly greater than theta
       Dp75	      11.1u   6.5u	6.5u	similar
       2ag  	      41-50   143	176	similar
       CKCamCa4	      35      494	1.1u	theta 2x greater
       CKpCamCa4      0	      17	75	theta 4x greater
       PkcCaDag	      3	      39	60	theta 2x greater
       CapDgl	      4	      27	59	theta 2x greater
       DagCapDgl      1	      18	37	theta 2x greater
------->Pkc and CKpCam are good. Amount of phospho Dgl is still small compared to non-phos, so effect on 2ag is difficult to see.
--------->1. Will need AC1 to see increased PKAc with theta.
	  2. Should CKpCam phos of Dgl be increased?
	  3. Should PKA activation be 2x faster?
>>>>>>Ca in spine is slightly higher than in dendrite during bath stimulation - this is fine
	 Da in spine is considerably higher than dend with bath (21 vs 10 uM), 20hz and theta stim (~4x greater) - should this be fixed?
	 
Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation).  Currently G protein production is considerably slower than DaD1RGs binding?
2. What happens if decrease ACh alone??
