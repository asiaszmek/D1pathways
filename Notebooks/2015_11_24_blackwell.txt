>>>>>>>>> indicates what we are trying to reproduce (goals)
---------> indicates conclusion from previous set of simulations of what needs to be done next
****** name of file that is either ready to go, or should have parameters changed according to --------->
########## indicates the set of parameters used for the set of simulations

NEXT STEPS:
***1. Merged Model:Updat MSPNmergedRateConst.xls and Rxn.xml file
2. Research PIkinase from Falkenberg
***3. repeat Da Bath to get more prolonged response (less ACh) using rates from cAMP assay
***4. Repeat BoHung stim sims using new PLC rates
5. Add in CamKII inhib of DagL
######### Results of additional slowdown: GasGTP hydrolysis rate = 0.125/sec, Kcat of GasGTP production = 0.25
    Also, simulate for 300 sec (beginning at 30 sec) for better pre stim baseline, and to see of pPDE4 begins to decay
----->Results
	basal cAMP = 56.  Peak GasGTP is lower, esp for lower stimuli
	peak cAMP ranges from 0.8uM to 2.3 uM
	peak PKAc ranges from 27 to 41 nM - wider range than before.  
     	     1s and 10s have similar peaks
	     300 ms slightly lower peak
     	     100 ms much lower peak
	Peak times: cAMP ranges from 36 to 44 msec (6- 14 msec after stim)
     	     	    PKAc ranges from 52 to 49 msec (22 - 19 msec after stim)
	pPDE4, other than 0.1s stim, has good response also, with more prolonged response.
Definitely more prolonged than with previous rate constants 
---------> keep these parameters
One problem remains: cAMP and PKAc remains elevated only for the 0.1 sec Da stim. Da remains relevated for 0.1 sec stim.  Though injecting on average same amount, there is no excess buffer
Rerun with slightly more buf injection (78.33)- may help reduce PKAc response to cAMP
----------> better: cAMP=662, PKAc=26.5; but still not good enough
	    try 78.35  buffer, and less inject: 15660 (vs 15666) - good, though now returns to below basal.
OVERALL: PKAc transient is faster than Castro, but pPDE4 transient is slower.
Then, onto merged model!!!
Gq pathways:
Based on discussions with Jeanette - and very small 2AG response with current Gq pathway parameters -  can lower GaqGDP hydrolysis from 30 to 15, for the PLCCa form, which will allow Gq to stay longer, and perhaps increase the Kcat for DAG production.
      	 Old  New    try 3x larger?   or 6x larger with Gap=30
PLCCa 	 25   0.09   0.27   	      0.54
PLCGqCa	 250  3	     9		      18
WILL NEED TO INCREASE Kf and Kb also, to avoid Kcat being larger than kb
Blank used GTPgammaS and obtained much higher rates.  perhaps Smrcka's lower overall rates come from GTP hydrolysis?

(A) peak time of either PKAc or phospho targets (pPDE10, pDaD1RGs, pPDE4) around 30-40 sec. (B) Peak values of 1 s and 10 s are the same, peak value of 0.3 s is 80% of 1s, peak value of 0.1 s is 50% of 1s. (C) What is target cAMP value?
