>>>>>>>>> indicates what we are trying to reproduce (goals)
---------> indicates conclusion from previous set of simulations of what needs to be done next
########## indicates the set of parameters used for the set of simulations

NEXT STEPS:
1. Merged Model:Finish updating MSPNmergedRateConst.xls
2. Research PIkinase from Falkenberg
3. repeat Da Bath to get more prolonged response (less ACh)
4. Continue to adjust cAMP assay, Neves and full model with PDE4
cAMP assay sims ready to go
Neves sims ready to go
------------------------------------------------------------------------
########## Added in PDE4 and PKAc phos of PDE4.  Added in 100 nM.  Eliminated cytosolic PDE10
Result
1. basal cAMP ~60 nM, which is good
2. cAMP was far too transient for all Da durations, which is bad.  pPDE4 increased too rapidly, though it remains quite small (~10 or 10%)
-------------> reduce rate of PDE4 phosphorylation
new rates: Kf=0.125e-3, Kb=0.12, Kcat=0.03 (~1/3 - 1/4 of previous)
    	   pPDE4 dephos = 0.025
Interestingly, pPDE10 continued to increase even once cAMP returned to basal.  This suggests that dephos is too weak.  
----------> pPDE10 dephos = 0.005
Possibly once adjusted, replacement of ACh will be less critical, i.e., can slow down ACh replacement
