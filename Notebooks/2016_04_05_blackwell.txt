&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		 3. Can extra high calcium substitute for dopamine in LTP?  If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq?
		    Simulate with decrease Da and increase Ca
		 4. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 5. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    Create signature
		    Can some molecules substitute for others (increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block)

&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2 model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 wit Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim
   

######### Repeating: Castro sims - quant and time course of PKA activity (using AKAR), cAMP
        Control of Dp34 (basal=400 nM, 11x with Da) and Dp75 (basal 11-12 uM, dec with Da)
		by Da Is concommitant reduction in ACh needed?
		by Ca
	  	with PP inhibitors     
--------->Castro results
		 Da = 12, 16, 20, 28 uM.  Da is pretty good for 0.1 sec, but still too high for longer durations.  Basal Da is 10-11 nM - Good
		 AKAR: 1000 (0.1s), 1700 (0.3s), 2850 (1s) and 3000 (100s).  Pretty good. May be slightly lower when Da is reduced a bit.  Should be 1 min, 1.5 min and >2 min for full decay - need to run all sims longer.
		  Change 100s DaD1 stim to 10 s - that is what Castro did.
--------->cAMP: basal = 60-65 a bit high; Dp34PP1 is 800-1000 at 70-80s (bath), but only 200-300 at 40-50 sec.  cAMP basal seems a bit high, and equilibrium of Dp34 takes a long time to reach.
		cAMP peak = 16 uM with 100sec stim (way too high - will be fixed with 10s stim)
		cAMP peak = 4 uM with 1 s stim, 2.6 (0.3s), 1.7 (0.1s).  These are OK.  Will be reduced with lower Da peak
------------> Bath stim: cAMP increases to 15 uM. Probably too large.
	      Dp34PP1 saturates with Da bath, Dp34 = 700.  Total=4.4uM 6-10x inc depending on true basal - correct
	      Dp34PP1=3.2 uM with Da+Ca - reduction, though possibly should be larger reduction?
	      Dp75: ~10 uM basal (should be larger, increase CDK5 by 5-10%)
	      	    dec to 6.5 uM with Ca,
		    dec to 5.7 uM with Da
		    dec to 4.8 uM with Da+Ca
	Da is 14 uM with Da bath - too large.  Reduce to 10 uM
-----> 20 Hz vs Theta
       PKAc: similar peak, but 20Hz decreases sooner.  Theta has delayed cAMP increase because ACh drops below basal - must be injecting too much Abuf!  Need more Abuf for dip because not sufficient.
Theta has much higher CKpCamCa4, slightly hgher pDgl peaks, but similar 2ag.

This suggests that CamKII is required, but need to know what ACh is doing, or what TANs are doing during 20 Hz and theta - if pause is more for theta, then cAMP & PKA would be greater.

######### New stim files:
1. change initial stim for all Da 0.1-100s
	<InjectionStim specieID="Da" injectionSite="sa1[0].pointA">
        <onset>           50000        </onset>
        <duration>           10         </duration>
        <rate>               1300    </rate>
     </InjectionStim>
2. lower follow-up stim - 1/4 of current value (rate =13) for Da Dur sims. rate=6.5 for DaBath
3. Change Dbuf inject to match (Castro sims)
4. Try to speed the Da decrease by injecting buffer much faster (10 ms), to lower DaOut
5. For 20hz vs theta, inc 1st Abuf inject and reduce 2nd (96,1.69 for 20Hz; 98,1.69 for theta)

Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation)
2. What happens if decrease ACh alone??
----------> Terrible results because I simultaneously reduced the volume.  Depth2D changed from 2.0 to 0.6, with reducing injected values.  Multiply all rates by 0.3
-------->Da duration: though too high, the ratio of prolonged to initial stim is good.
	    Bath: Ca and initial Da are too high (multiply by 0.3), but prolonged Da is good.
	    Stim: reduced Glu, Ca, Gbuf, ACh (multiply by 0.3)
##########Completely new Stim files:
a. eliminate Abuf.  Replace with constant basal ACh inject, coupled with  constant ACh degrad.
b. all remaining rates multiply by 0.3 since using 0.3 2D depth - smaller volume
