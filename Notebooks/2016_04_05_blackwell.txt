&&&&&&& Notes

&&&&&&& Big Question: How do neuromodulators interact with calcium to control plasticity direction
Small questions: 1. How does ACh contribute to LTP or LTD
      		    Do sims with and without ACh modulation
		    What is role of ACh burst vs pause (eliminate one or the other)
      		 2. How do D1 and D2 neurons differ in their response
		    Simulate both D1 and D2 neurons
		 3. Can extra high calcium substitute for dopamine in LTP?  If so, how does extra high calcium produce LTD without Gq?
		    Simulate with decrease Da and increase Ca
		 4. What is the role of phosphorylation of Dgl in LTP (already demonstrated for LTD)?
		    Block CaMKII phos of Dgl and repeat sims
		 5. Which molecules differ between theta and 20 Hz? (theta and 20 Hz)
		    Create signature
		    Can some molecules substitute for others (increase Ca and decrease Gq via mGlu block)

&&&&&&& To finish model:
1. D1R model:
   PKA phos of RGS (enzyme assay); possibly tune G pathways and CaMKII  - Dgl rates (Jeanette's group)
   PKA + RGS <-> pRGS + PKA (2 steps)
   RGS + GiGTP <-> RGS + GiGDP (2 steps - rate similar to current spontaneous)
   pRGS + GiGTP <-> pRGS + GiGDP (2 steps - 10x faster?)
   pRGS -> RGS (adjust rate for low basal)
2. To create D2 model
     Aden (stim files) + A2AR  (affinity measures, reactions)
   a. Replace D1 wit Aden params
   b. Use D2R values instead of m4R values
   c. Replace ACh stim with Aden stim
   
########### Restuls of new Stim files:
a. eliminate Abuf.  Replace with constant basal ACh inject, coupled with  constant ACh degrad.
-----------> Da Dur: ACh decayed to zero.  (no injection) - add injection
b. all remaining rates multiply by 0.3 since using 0.3 2D depth - smaller volume
-----> Good, but Da for dur a bit too low.  Increase 20%
---------->basal Dp34PP1 way too high, especially for Da Dur which has no ACh inject
	increase ACh inject slightly, and/or lower m4R affinity
	what about Gq pathways: basal IP3 is a bit high, so lower ACh, but raise m4R affinity
-----> ACh during 20Hz and theta do not exhibit dip, also the burst is too small
       need to increase injection, decrease duration, and pause the low injection
############ Adjusted stim files - better ACh and affinity, to decrease basal cAMP, etc.
1. ACh inject of 0.5 for entire time for Da Dur sims, 20% inc rate for prolonged Da inject
2. 4x increase in ACh affinity for m4R in Rxn file
3. ACh during 20Hz and theta
   a. increase inject 2x
   c. pause the constant injection - inject constant prior to Da stim, then set up periodic inject with 2s pauses
   d. prolong the rebound inject (from 400 to 800 ms)
-----> Da for dur still a bit too low.  Increase another 20%
       cAMP basal much better ~55-60
       Dp34PP1 basal ~300 - a bit low, but much better.  Could increase with lower Ca basal.
       Dp75 basal - 10.5 uM - excellent
----->ACh is beautiful!  Exhibits dip, though not quite to zero. Could lower the dip by stopping the ACh inject a bit earlier.        2ag, Dag,Ip3 still have high basal levels.  Possibly due to elevated ACh, though affinity is quite low: 3.8 uM for high affinity site.  Probably need to fix this 3.8uM high affinity site - should be 630 nM.  FIXED.
	  Pkc is quite low stimulated - increase ACh during stim
 ######### new Stim:
 	   8.0 Ach stim during Da &Ca stim
	   Begin basal stim at 52.2 sec (instead of 52.0 s)
	   new Rxn file: correct m1RGq affin for ACh
	   halve Ca leak from Out to in - 0.25
   
Still need to evaluate the following:
1. Chuhma et al., 2014: 10 ms time constant for action of activated G proteins -> may need faster G protein production (and degradation)
2. What happens if decrease ACh alone??
