&&&&&&& Notes

###### Ip3->Ip3degrad has kf =0.5 (instead of 1.0)
       PIkinase kf = 0.001 (instead of 0.002) and kcat=0.25 (isntead of 1)
       GluMgluR -> GluMgluRdesens has kf=0.125 (instead of 0.25)
       Dag binds to CaDgl with kf=0.00125 (instead of 0.0025e-3)
       5s stim, increase 3d of Ca to 5/25 from 3/15
       Re-adjust IC: IC_MSPNmergeSpinePKAcD1R_PDEhigh for the mGluR-Gq pathway.  Was missing some IC terms, and some totals not quite correct
       Note that in the spine head, 1 molecule = 40 nM, so don't try to be more precise than rounding to the 10s, and best set to 0 molecule with less than 40 nM.

------------> IP3degrad still too fast, Dag decay still too fast
------------> Glu still not high enough, possibly also Ca too low
------------> Not all sims are working - bug in code.  Rerun with new code before increasing Glu or Ca inject

Research PIkinase from Falkenberg, and search for Dag kinase and DagLipase rates.  Find more sources for quantities.  
falkenburger: PI4 kinase: 2.6e-4 / sec
falkenburger: PI5kinase: 0.02/sec - ~10x slower than catalytic rate of PIkinase
Xu Watras Loew 2003 - PIP2synth basal = 0.048/sec - faster than falkenburger.  Perhaps 0.1/sec at 37 deg
falkenburger: IPase: 0.08/sec; Xu Watras Loew 2003 - 0.16/sec at 37 deg
Falkenburger J Gen Phys 2013 Dag degradation = 0.05/sec  (is this 20 C?)
Shulga et al. FEBS letters, 	  DagKepsilon: Vmax=1.7 nmol PA/min (enzyme quant unknown), Km = 2 mol%
Shulga et al. J Mol Biol 2011	  DagKepsilon: Vmax=10.2/sec (WT, against SAG)
D'Souza and Epand 2012:	 	  DagKEpsilon: 0.0115 nmol PA/min/ng enz	  MW=63.9273 kD 
	    	  		  	       0.0115*64e3 ng/nmol*1min/60sec ~10 (assuming puring enzyme)
Rosenburger Lipids 2007:	DagL Vmax=100-616 nmol/min/mg, MW=27kDa (depends on species)
	    	   		     550*1e-3umol/nmol*1min/60sec*27mg/um = 0.2475;  Km = 63 uM
>>>>>>>>> GOALS:
	  0.16 uM IP3 basal
	  lower PA and IP3degrad
	  maybe as high as 100 nM Dag basal
	  
##########PIkinase lower: kcat=0.1, kb=0.4, halve kf=0.0005 - Km=1 uM, kcat from Xu Watras Loew
	  Ip3->Ip3degrad kf = 0.1 (instead of 0.5), kf from Xu Watras Loew
	  DagK lower: kcat=0.2/sec Falkenburger J Gen Phys 2013 (lower than expt - alternatively lower quantity)
	  Dag Lipase: Vmax=550 nmol/min/mg, MW=27kDa,use Km=2.5 uM (justify from not true membrane)
	      	       Kcat=0.25/sec, kb=1/sec, kf adjusted for km-2.5 uM
	  2ag deg = 0.25 (lower similar to Dag Lipase)
	  
RESULTS - basal 2ag=40-60, Dag=70-95, Ip3=135-165, PA=78
Bug in code has been fixed - is not responsible for low Glu.  Rerun sims with higher Glu:
##########    kf for Glu -> GluOut=0.5 (instead of 1.0)
    	      stochdiff-3.0.0-10.jar
RESULTS
	Glu reaches 14 uM, and close to saturates the receptor.  Affinity of glu for mGlur is too low at 20 uM.  Change to 6.6 uM, increase Stim slightly.  Also increase calcium
##########


IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Analyze AUC of 2ag vs PKC 
2. Add in CamKII inhib of DagL from Colbran publications
   File created.  kcat of 120 sec from Fig 2 in Shonesy - ~2 min to reach 1/e of peak DagL phos
   Kb = 4xkcat, kf selected for uM affinity (~same as Dgl quantity)
   pDagL activity 50% that of DagL activity.  dephos needs to be adjusted.  Sims not yet begun
   Evaluate how CamKII inhib affects 2ag and PKC in DSI:
   	    Evaluate quantity of CamKII and pCamKII produced during DSI - 1 s may be insufficient, hence no inhibition, but 5s should be sufficient - as long as stim during LTP.  On the other hand, depol may produce less calcium elevation than synaptic stimulation
   	    Compare to previous Rxn file sims, and compare by blocking pCamKII phos of DagL. 
3. Replace Ad Hoc stim files with calcium from Asia's SP neuron in response to depol
ADDITIONAL NEXT STEPS
1. Resolve whether (which) molecule conc in spine head need to be higher than dend surface density.  Currently, PKA, AC, PDE10, mGluR, Gq, PLC, Pip2, DagK and PIK are higher
2. Repeat theta and 20Hz simulations, but with Da also - compare effect of CamKII inhib of DagL
3. Consider role in PP2B in localizing PKA (Dell'Acqua), anchoring of CamKII at PSD, STEP-Fyn role in PKA control of calcium influx, Ser 137 phosphorylation of NMDA to enhance calcium influx, other Darpp32 phos site
4. What questions are we answering with model?
   Role of CaMKII inhib of DagL - really just confirming experiment
   Which molecules discriminate temporal pattern?
   What is role of Da and PKA in producing LTP vs LTD?

&&&&Affinity of mGluR = 500 nM Mol Pharmacol. 1994 Apr;45(4):626-36. Catania MV1, De Socarraz H, Penney JB, Young AB.; affinity of dhpg is 2uM (mGluR5) 6.6 uM (mGluR1), 30 uM CNS Drug Reviews Volume 8, p101, Wisniewski & Car
WILL NEED TO INCREASE AFFINITY of mGLuR when glu represents glu (during theta) instead of in the Uchi sims, where it represents DHPG

&&&&&&&&&&& Due to stochastic nature of molecule initialization, should not use computer program to create IC files from output of steady state sims.  Need to ensure that molecule totals don't change, and don't initialize values in spines that are less than 1 molecule
