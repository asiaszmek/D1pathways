Next steps:
1. plc assay: create xml for 
   par1={'species':'GaqGTP','values':[0,261],'type':'NanoMolarity'}
   par2={'species':'Ca','values':[10,30,100,300,1e3,3e3,10e3],'type':'NanoMolarity'}
   simulate analyze, compare to smrcka
   create xml for 
   par1={'species':'GaqGTP','values':[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80],'type':'NanoMolarity'}
   par2={'species':'Ca','values':[1,300],'type':'NanoMolarity'}
   simulate, analyze (change xval to pv[0]), compare to smrcka
2. create cAMP subset for cAMP assay (merged) 
   dend only with submembrane voxels to achieve
   correct surface to volume, and also large volume
   may need to run to steady state first
3. assess steady state values related to calcium stuff
4. Darpp assay
   dend only with submembrane voxels to achieve
   correct surface to volume, and also large volume
   may need to update IC files with a reasonable ss starting place

QUESTIONS:
General:
1. How do dopamine and acetylcholine contribute to learning and synaptic plasticity in the striatum.
2. How do Da and ACh contribute to or control activation of memory kinases?

More Specific:
1. How do Da and ACh via the M4, D1 and M1 receptors influence activation of memory kinases?
2. Can post-synaptic signaling pathways, activated by calcium, D1, M1 and M4, discriminate temporal patterns?
3. Which of these signaling molecules/receptor convey spatial specificity?
4. How can dopamine reinforce only those glutamate inputs that came prior, and not after?
	Is AC1 the only mechanism to provide temporal specificity?
5. Does the location of the D1/M4/Golf/Gi/AC complex, i.e. spine versus dendrite, change activation of kinases?
6. Does 10.5 Hz theta optimize some post-synaptic signaling pathways?

7. Are both mGluR and M1 required for 20 Hz LTD?  Lerner and Kreitzer show mGluR and PLC required.

8. Is CaMKII required for Theta burst LTP, to inhibit ECB production?
EXPER: add inhibitor peptide (10.5 Theta, DM)

EXPER: Is CB1 required for Theta burst LTP (first check that AM251 blocks 20 Hz LTD)?
After showing that AM251 blocks 20 Hz LTD DM, then do expers on Theta LTP DM.

Is CB1 required for striatal dependent learning (what about PKA, PKC and CaMKII)?
EXPER: In vivo infusion of drugs into striatum during behavioral task acquisition

MODEL Procedure:
MOST OF THIS IS NOW WRITTEN IN README. PLEASE UPDATE THERE
DONE: 0. Create git repository on a computer that both GMU and KTH have access to.
1. Merge BoHung Gq/PKC + Gq/2AG model with Rodrigo Golf model, possibly tweak parameters (adjust calcium buffer quantities, less constrained binding affinities, to make sure basal calcium is correct).
	possibly with epac, use input from calcium model
2. Add in Gi pathways, adjust D1/M4/Gi/Gs/AC/PDE10 (tweak parameters or quantity) to obtain correct basal cAMP
DONE? 3. Adjust the PKA activity rates (Castro), PKA diffusion rate (Shane Tillo &Zhang/myristolation), CaMKII diffusion rate (2Lu HE, MacGillavry HD, Frost NA, Blanpied TA.J Neurosci. 2014 May 28;34(22):7600-10).
3. Add in CaMKII inhibition of DAGLipase (Shonesy BC, Wang X, Rose KL, Ramikie TS, Cavener VS, Rentz T, Baucum AJ 2nd, Jalan-Sakrikar N, Mackie K, Winder DG, Patel S, Colbran RJ. Nat Neurosci. 2013 Apr;16(4):456-63.) and PKA phosphorylation of RGS4, which accelerates Gq hydrolysis.
4. Other quantities / locations may need to be updated:
Differential association of postsynaptic signaling protein complexes in striatum and hippocampus.
Baucum AJ 2nd, Brown AM, Colbran RJ.J Neurochem. 2013
mGluR are peri-synaptic
M1 is at spine neck to dendrite (Uchigashima J Neurosci 2007 - slightly further away from PSD than mGluR)
==>>> M1 and mGluR5 leads to IPSC suppression, only mGluR5 produces EPSC suppression
(Also, stronger CB1 expression on GABA synapses)
M4 must be near D1 both of which must be near AC. D1/M4/Golf/Gi/AC complex is in the spine, might also be in the dendrite.
5. Finish Tweaking - immobilize DARPP32 (Blom et al. Brismar PLoS One 2013)

6. Do we add ERK to this model, or do we run simulations and publish this and THEN add in ERK 
RasGRF to RasGTP to Raf to MEK to ERK.
PKA phos STEP, which dephos ERK
PP1 dephos STEP, pSTEP is inactive
What about epac -> RapGTP -> Raf?
What about PKA phos Raf?

STIMULATION PROTOCOLS:
20 Hz vs theta calcium / Glutamate input
Da input similar to what Lovinger has measured
What is temporal pattern of ACh?

Q1: Does theta have higher memory kinases (PKA+PKC) than 20 Hz?
SIMULATION to answer question:
1. Stimulate using theta rhythym, stimulate using 20 Hz, quantify PKA and PKC
Q2: What happens if caMKII or PKA is blocked? - compare to new and old field experiments
2. Stimulate with kcat of PKA =0, or kcat of CamKII = 0
Q3: What happens if DaR, m1R or mGluR5 are blocked? - compare to old (LTP) and new (LTD) field experiments
3. Stimulate, but with no Da, or no glu, or no ACh.
Q4: What sort of spatial specificity do we get?
4. Stimulate 1 spine, look at value at other spine
Q5: Does model exhibit similar sensitivity to theta frequency?
