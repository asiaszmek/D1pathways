High level view of questions to address and how we create a model to do this
QUESTIONS:
General:
1. How do dopamine and acetylcholine contribute to learning and synaptic plasticity in the striatum.
2. How do Da and ACh contribute to or control activation of memory kinases?

More Specific:
1. How do Da and ACh via the M4, D1 and M1 receptors influence activation of memory kinases?
2. Can post-synaptic signaling pathways, activated by calcium, D1, M1 and M4, discriminate temporal patterns?
3. Which of these signaling molecules/receptor convey spatial specificity?
4. How can dopamine reinforce only those glutamate inputs that came prior, and not after?
	Is AC1 the only mechanism to provide temporal specificity?
5. Does the location of the D1/M4/Golf/Gi/AC complex, i.e. spine versus dendrite, change activation of kinases?
6. Does 10.5 Hz theta optimize some post-synaptic signaling pathways?

7. Are both mGluR and M1 required for 20 Hz LTD?  Lerner and Kreitzer show mGluR and PLC required.

8. Is CaMKII required for Theta burst LTP, to inhibit ECB production?
EXPER: add inhibitor peptide (10.5 Theta, DM)

EXPER: Is CB1 required for Theta burst LTP (first check that AM251 blocks 20 Hz LTD)?
After showing that AM251 blocks 20 Hz LTD DM, then do expers on Theta LTP DM.

Is CB1 required for striatal dependent learning (what about PKA, PKC and CaMKII)?
EXPER: In vivo infusion of drugs into striatum during behavioral task acquisition

SIMULATIONS to answer question:
Q1: Does theta have higher memory kinases (PKA+PKC) than 20 Hz?
1. Stimulate using theta rhythym, stimulate using 20 Hz, quantify PKA and PKC
Q2: What happens if caMKII or PKA is blocked? - compare to new and old field experiments
2. Stimulate with kcat of PKA =0, or kcat of CamKII = 0
Q3: What happens if DaR, m1R or mGluR5 are blocked? - compare to old (LTP) and new (LTD) field experiments
3. Stimulate, but with no Da, or no glu, or no ACh.
Q4: What sort of spatial specificity do we get?
4. Stimulate 1 spine, look at value at other spine
Q5: Does model exhibit similar sensitivity to theta frequency?
